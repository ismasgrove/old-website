    ah, navigation, what I suppose is the primarily reason why content
    management systems are so popular.

    I'm a minimalist by nature. so I feel like arrows are sufficient. I don't
    even feel like menu/list styled nav bars are necessary. after all, this is a
    page for web experiments. I think it'd be fun to explore simply by going
    right, sequentially. It's not large enough to warrant a switch to something
    that looks like a portfolio. I'm probably going to look at things here as
    pathetic little toys in a few months, but hey, that's part of taking
    ownership of your code, right?

    in other news, I just
    <a href="https://github.com/ismasgrove/raytracing">finished</a> implementing
    my Rust raytracer based on Peter Shirley's first book in his Raytracing
    series, and am very exciting to move on with the rest. I'm curious if I can
    import it into web assembly and have it work on the browser? that should be
    fun.

    I like Rust. I won't necessarily hop on the 'better C++' train, but I do
    think writing Rust code every once in a while makes you a better C++
    programmer. the compiler essentially marks in you, sometimes with molten
    metal, good programming habits. I hope there'll be opportunities to use it
    more in my career, aside from hobby projects.
