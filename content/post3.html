    our puzzle for the day is, why doesn't this model have a face? (ignoring
    that it is a model of miku doing the samba dance, that is)
  </p>
  <canvas id="post3_canvas" width="600px" height="600px"> </canvas>
  <p>
    and by face, I'm not talking about facial features. I'm talking about its
    color. why is it transparent?
  </p>
  <p>
    there are plenty of options to consider. maybe the lighting used simply
    rendered her face transparent (this sounds completely unintuitive, doesn't
    it? graphics makes you paranoid about every little detail) and it can be
    solved simply by using a different kind of light setting.
  </p>
  <p>
    the other option is 'this model is supposed to have a texture on its face,
    but it is missing (not embedded nor externally present).' in which case,
    isn't threejs simply supposed to use its material colors? that is what it
    did for the other meshes. it probably attempted to read the face texture,
    failed, and fell back to #000000 as a default.
  </p>
  <p>
    if you're wondering why most people who program games or do graphics
    programming have at least a basic proficiency in 3d modeling software
    (despite not necessarily knowing how to model things) this is why. it's a
    lot simpler and easier to simply adjust your models in a way that would
    compliment your software than the other way around. surely, your software
    has to be conclusive enough to decrease that workload (which is why
    libraries such as Assimp are widely used), but regardless, there'll always
    be a model that shows an outlier behavior, one that you'll need to manually
    adjust, if only just to debug something.
