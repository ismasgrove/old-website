    hello. my name's isma and I'm a computer scientist. not my real name but one
    of my favorite things about software is that it's one of the few professions
    where it's fine for people to work under a nickname (even in the old times,
    security researcher aleph one comes to mind). most other notable professions
    that share this advantage fall under the entertainment industry.

    and in a way, that's I'm most passionate about as a programmer. there's no
    doubt computers aid in creating a significant portion of our entertainment
    these days, even aside from the obvious example that is video games. from
    computer-generated imagery all the way to the new sounds musicians and
    effects artists have access to. out of the many things a computer can do to
    augment our lives, I think generating aesthetically pleasing content for our
    senses is the most impressive.
