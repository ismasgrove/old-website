    it's only when you're making things like this do you realize why people
    moved on to CMS platforms (e.g. wordpress) and more elaborative frameworks
    that take care of the dirty work for you (e.g. angular). but for my purposes
    I'd say a good old static html page is perfect (even though it still doesn't
    look pretty - I prefer this 1998-ish appearance to the Bootstrappy-look that
    reminds me of a certain college project).
  </p>
  <p>
    after all, I wouldn't identify as a web developer (at the moment). the main
    goal of this website is to experiment with webGL, animejs and webassembly as
    those technologies interest me.
  </p>
  <p>
    the second goal is to explore the webdev-sphere in general. I think it's fun
    to explore new technology in this manner. after all, I have to climb some
    distance before I start finding place and use for those technologies on my
    own (I dislike the idea of using a webpage that is an empty canvas to
    'experiment' with webGL). I was exploring 'new' things in web that I wasn't
    familiar with, and the things I met along the way? they're interesting.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS grids, for example, are super simple and intuitive. SASS, which I'm
    definitely not utilizing to its maximum potential, is very promising. I also
    thought about making this website in using gatsby, but decided that would be
    too much investment, again, for my purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    lastly, there's Typescript. I like type safety (very predictable from
    someone who likes C++ and Rust) so I thought about using it (and an earlier
    version of this very post declared it
    <i>would</i> be used) but I decided against it, as that would add another
    dimension to my endeavor (which, is supposed to be purely 'graphical') so
    I'm using plain old JS now, will try to get exposure to its newest features
    throughout this experiment.

        different posts will have their own files and they'll be loaded into the
        main page. for now it's the most convenient way for my purposes.

        for the time being, good ol' arrows will do the job. once the website
        has more content to warrant a menu/list-style nav system or an archive,
        I'll add one.

        we have a rotating cube. change the cube into something more
        interesting. an icon, of some sort.

  <p>
    for now, I will consider this 'post' the homepage (hence the title) and will
    use it to track my progress on the website.
