            it's only when you're making things like this do you realize why
            people moved on to CMS platforms (e.g. wordpress) and more
            elaborative frameworks that take care of the dirty work for you
            (e.g. angular). but for my purposes I'd say a good old static html
            page is perfect (even though it still doesn't look pretty).
          </p>
          <p>
            after all, I wouldn't identify as a web developer (at the moment).
            the main goal of this website is to experiment with webGL, animejs
            and webassembly as those technologies interest me.
          </p>
          <p>
            the second goal is to explore the webdev-sphere in general. I think
            it's fun to explore new technology in this manner. after all, I have
            to climb some distance before I start finding place and use for
            those technologies on my own (I dislike the idea of using a webpage
            that is an empty canvas to 'experiment' with webGL). I was exploring
            'new' things in web that I wasn't familiar with, and the things I
            met along the way? they're interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS grids, for example, are super simple and intuitive. SASS, which
            I'm definitely not utilizing to its maximum potential, is very
            promising. I also thought about making this website in using gatsby,
            but decided that would be too much investment, again, for my
            purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            lastly, there's Typescript. I like type safety (very predictable
            from someone who likes C++ and Rust) so I thought about using it
            (and an earlier version of this very post declared it
            <strong>shall</strong> be used) but that would add another dimension
            to my endeavor (which, is supposed to be purely 'graphical') so I'm
            using plain old JS now, will try to get exposure to its newest
            features throughout this experiment.
          </p>

                add an indicator that a post is scrollable that is not a clunky
                scrollbar

                we have a rotating cube, the same one in the default threeJS
                tutorial albeit rendererd inside a canvas with a transparent
                background. change the cube into something more interesting.
